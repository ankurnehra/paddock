## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are great and much appreciated! However, they should remain focused in terms of scope and intuitive in terms of desired functionality.

There are two main branches, `master` and `develop`.

- `master`: **stable version** of the application
- `develop`: development version - all the PRs, hot-fixes, improvements **should always target this branch.**

Thank you again, kind stranger, for your contribution to paddock. A place on the grid is yours!
